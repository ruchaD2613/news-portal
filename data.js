            "content": "DEAR ABBY: I live with my longtime boyfriend, “George,” and his 88-year-old father, “Frank.” Frank is not your average 88-year-old. He does almost everything anyone in their 60s would do. However, he’s used to us having dinner for him at the same time every night because he’s very regimented about everything. Frank gets everything taken care of and never has to worry about a thing. He pretty much keeps to himself. We have a coffee machine that’s easy to use, but Frank expects to have his coffee at a specific time as well. He refuses to even try to make it himself, which means we can’t sleep in even if we want to (we are retired). I hate that Frank lives with us because it has caused a lot of problems between George and me. I feel trapped. If I have a disagreement with Frank, George takes his father’s side, even when he’s wrong. We cannot financially have Frank in his own place, either. I own a third of our house (no mortgage). All three of us depend on our Social Security for household expenses, and Frank pays the insurance on the cars. I just feel that as much as I do for them, I should get some backup. Please let me know your thoughts. -- FEELING USED IN FLORIDA DEAR FEELING USED: If you haven’t told George how trapped and unhappy you feel, you should. If you are the maid, cook and laundress, perhaps it’s time he assumed responsibility for his father. Suggest he invest in an automatic coffeemaker that can be set for a specific time the night before Frank’s morning coffee is expected. That way you can sleep in if you wish. From your letter, it’s clear to me your problems with the men in your life go beyond coffee duty. If you are truly unhappy with this arrangement (which, predictably, won’t last forever), consider consulting an attorney or a financial adviser about how to access the money you have invested in that house so you can live independently. DEAR ABBY: My wife and I had an excellent relationship that involved a lot of partying. After I was injured on the job, I became addicted to painkillers, which resulted in a 20-year battle with addiction. Over the years of trying unsuccessfully to get sober, I asked my wife to slow down her drinking to help me get sober. She refused and, ultimately, our marriage fell apart. We decided to stay together until our kids were out of school and, wouldn’t you know, no sooner did we separate than I was able to get sober. I know it wasn’t her fault I was addicted. I think I’m probably better off getting divorced, but I still love her, and I’m curious if you think we should end it or give it another try. -- SOBER GUY IN MASSACHUSETTS DEAR SOBER GUY: To drink or not to drink is a choice. If your wife was unwilling to sacrifice imbibing in order to help you overcome your addiction, you were right to separate from her. Congratulations on your sobriety. If you wish to maintain it, follow through with that divorce. You have my sympathy. I hope you find someone more supportive in years to come.",

            "content": "Dear Amy: I just lost my first pregnancy to miscarriage about a week ago. This was particularly difficult because my husband and I had been trying for a while and really wanted to be parents. In all my excitement, I had told everybody I was pregnant, so I then had to go back and let everybody know the bad news. Everybody expressed their sympathy and asked me if there’s anything they could do. The honest answer was yes – all I really wanted was flowers so the house could feel beautiful and full of life during this time of sadness. I thought it sounded rude to ask, since I assumed at least a few of them would send flowers anyway. I thought it would take away from the generosity of the gift if I’d asked for them. Well, here we are a week later, and my house has no flowers. I guess I just want to know if I should have asked for the flowers when people asked, “Is there anything I can do?” It feels even ruder to ask now, and to point out that I really did have silent expectations, and nobody met them. Should I just go to the store and buy all my own flowers at this point? If this situation ever comes back around, should I just ask for the flowers next time? – Looking for Grief Etiquette Dear Looking: I’m so sorry you are experiencing this complicated loss. It might help you to understand that some people have an extremely negative reaction to flowers after a loss, because the scent, followed by the inevitable wilting and deterioration, can be a powerful trigger for grief. I’m writing a prescription for you to go out today and purchase a flowering potted plant – something appropriate for your area that you could then plant in the ground when the seasons change. I hope you will also ask your friends and family members directly to send you flowers! It’s not too late. Giving them a specific task and a clear way to help will unite all of you. One idea would be to ask your most reliable friend or family member to coordinate a delivery of one fresh bouquet each week for the next month or so – each from a different friend. Dear Amy: I’m in a new relationship with a man I have known for years. He keeps emails and text messages from a woman he was previously in a relationship with. Some of those texts from her are sexual in nature. The woman also sends pictures of herself to him. Although her communication with him is becoming less frequent, I can’t help but wonder why he keeps these reminders. When she contacts him it’s always about how she loves him and she knows he loves her. He does not contact her back, so I say, “Why keep this mess?” – Upset Dear Upset: In our still-evolving digital age, “blocking, muting, hiding, and ignoring” exes are all issues that couples may need to openly navigate, while they move toward the all-important romantic digital touchstones of deleting your dating profiles and announcing your relationship status on social media. Why does your guy keep this mess? Does he maintain digital trophies from all of his previous relationships? Is he in fact ghosting this previous girlfriend, rather than using his grown-up voice to actually and officially break up with her? Because this bothers you, you should ask him! This should not be an interrogation, but a conversation. Do not tell him what to do, but do tell him how this makes you feel. You’ve known this man for a long time, but setting parameters in a committed and exclusive relationship is a process of getting to know someone in a new way. If his behavior continually triggers your own insecurity or jealousy, then you might need to retreat into the friend zone. Dear Amy: “No-Brady Lady” wondered how to respond to the enthusiasm for football from her friends that she does not share. I also live in an area that is super into football. I feel her pain. There is no getting away from it, no matter where you go. Whenever people start trying to discuss football with me, I just look at them and say, “You’ll have to give me a moment. I have to work up to caring.” It is generally well-received by those who know me, and is usually followed up with laughter. – Who Cares? Dear Who Cares?: I like it! Let’s get those T-shirts made.",

            "content": "‘Luther: The Fallen Sun’ review: Making the jump from TV to film, even if you have a hugely popular show to begin with, is never easy. Misery is part of the “Luther” equation. It’s visited on suspects and victims and detectives and, to some extent, the audience watching it. Over five seasons, it’s been a cornerstone of the BBC crime drama, a neverending series of rock-bottoms (emotionally, not necessarily in quality). That overpowering darkness has been a major “Luther” throughline, coupled with the shuffling in and out of the coworkers and compatriots of DCI John Luther (Idris Elba). He’s had partners — in most senses of the word — die in front of him. He’s uncovered grisly killings and mutilated bodies. Those five seasons have been a steady dose of one-upping, to see how much one man can survive. So after almost a decade of rumblings, the long-discussed “Luther” movie has arrived. “Luther: The Fallen Sun” is more adaptation than extension, changing the environment and Luther’s toolset in a way that makes it accessible for viewers who haven’t already spent 20 hours tracking his on-screen saga. After a quick prelude, the movie finds Luther behind bars. He’s locked away, but not for reasons that the end of the last TV season might have implied. (Aside from a quick shot of the Season 5 killer in one news report, “The Fallen Sun” is yada-yadaing a lot of what that last finale might have set in motion.) From jail, where he’s also a target of men in nearby cells, Luther gets a taunting message from David Robey (Andy Serkis), England’s latest criminal mastermind and a man personally targeting the former detective. Believing himself to be the only person capable of stopping Robey before he kills again, Luther sets in motion a plan to spring himself free and track down this killer in person. What’s about? After a long stretch of getting the bad guy at pretty much any cost, Detective John Luther (Idris Elba) finally finds himself breaking one rule too many. He starts off heading to a prison cell, leaving sadistic cyber blackmailer/serial killer David Robey (a very disturbing Andy Serkis) free to carry on doing unpleasant criminal stuff around London while he’s locked away. Luther is not about to let some measly prison bars and half the Metropolitan Police Force stand in his way of catching a bad guy, so he quickly breaks out of prison and gives chase. What follows is a dark, hectic cat (and cat) and mouse game where Luther attempts to track down Robey while the police are on the disgraced detective’s own heels. With his list of living former associates left awfully thin after the events of Season 5, the other main holdover from the show is former boss Martin Schenk (Dermot Crowley). Soon, he and Luther’s de facto replacement Odette Raine (Cynthia Erivo) are fighting a two-pronged battle: find out who’s leaving elaborate displays of death all over London and keep Luther from interfering. It helps that Erivo and Crowley provide steady hands because their characters certainly have their hands full on both accounts. Whether it’s a go-for-broke strategy to make Luther feel more like a big-screen superhero or a symptom of a film industry that can’t support substantially-budgeted stories unless the entire world is in danger, “Luther: The Fallen Sun” isn’t content with mere gestures toward the operatic. Luther doesn’t have to take on a few men while trying to bust out of prison — it has to be four dozen. It’s not enough that Robey is driving people to their death — it has to be a public spectacle. Where the show used to thrive on the idea of an ugliness lurking in the open corners of daily life, this movie works triply hard to weave together anxieties about privacy and the surveillance state, putting it all toward something more showy than shocking. Original series writer Neil Cross, who’s been open about his penchant for putting his characters through the most exquisite torture imaginable, takes on the same duties here. “Luther: The Fallen Sun” is also a re-teaming with Jamie Payne, who helped deliver a Season 5 that brought the show back to its roots before ending in a parade of explosive violence. Both Cross and Payne are successful in dealing with the claustrophobic side of “Luther,” showing a man who is running out of options and room to run. Once “Luther: The Fallen Sun” brings its hero out into the open, the movie becomes a chaotic mess painted on too big a canvas. Serkis is at least trying to inject some theatrical fun into all of this, clad in a truly garish hairpiece while Robey harbors widespread dreams of cooking up a global blackmail network. For all the questions Elba’s had to answer over the years about the one franchise role he never got, this movie is enough to make you wonder if Serkis has always harbored dreams of being a Bond villain. Yet, the “Luther” baddies have historically been the one place that this fictional world has made its misery make sense. Some of them had flair, but there was deep pain to go along with it. Even someone with the pluck and sassiness of Ruth Wilson’s Alice Morgan (a character not even whispered about here) ultimately chose a vindictive over a clean getaway. It’s a paradox that in a film/TV series desperately lacking in fun, Robey is somehow having too much of it. It’s that mismatched spirit that’s symptomatic of “Luther: The Fallen Sun” as whole. It’s not that Serkis or Erivo or Elba is necessarily failing. It’s that they all seem to be plucked from different worlds and smushed together out of necessity, something that comes across most in an overstuffed climactic showdown filled with ideas that “Luther” has done more practically and effectively before. Watching “Luther: The Fallen Sun” feels like watching a lesser version of “Die Hard with a Vengeance,” as if this was a repurposed Cross script retrofitted to be the “Luther” movie everyone’s been asking for: Start with a more general premise of a cat-and-mouse trackdown of a technovillain, but add some creepy masks, a whiff of sexual frustration, and Luther himself. By the time some overly ambitious special effects work gets added to the soup, the pot starts overflowing. It’s extra frustrating when so many of the quieter moments have some of that classic “Luther” touch. There’s a small bit of grace in a sequence where Luther comforts someone who thinks they’re about to die. There’s a tiny thrill in seeing Luther outsmart someone who’s told him too much but doesn’t realize it yet. There’s ruthlessness and emptiness on screen for a good portion of this movie’s 129 minutes, but there are also glimpses of a beating heart underneath. Holding onto a little humanity in the face of cruelty led to the show’s best moments. There’s just not enough in “Luther: The Fallen Sun” that’s worth fighting for. : February 24, 2023 (Theaters), March 10, 2023 (Netflix) : Jamie Payne Neil Cross Idris Elba, Andy Serkis, Cynthia Erivo, and Dermot Crowley R (disturbing/violent content, language and some sexual material)",

            "description": "Oregon State's rebound could come as soon as next season if the team's current roster remains intact and returns for 2023-24",
            "content": "In a sense, Oregon State’s in Thursday’s Pac-12 women’s basketball tournament quarterfinals was snapshot of the Beavers’ 2022-23 season. So much promise. Great moments. Frustrating stretches. Incredible will. Came up short. Such was the story of Oregon State’s 13-18 season. The Beavers threw a scare into many of the country’s best teams this season. Beat a few of them, even. Came close so many times, but whether it was youth or a missing piece, the losses mounted. It was no different Thursday. The 11th-seeded Beavers didn’t flinch when playing No. 3 Colorado, a team that pounded OSU a month ago in Corvallis. Oregon State gave Colorado fits early on, taking a 27-18 lead with an offense that looked as good as it had all season. Then came the frustration, a 14-minute stretch when the Beavers could only score eight points. It didn’t deter OSU, even when trailing by 11 and less than six minutes left. The Beavers made a run at Colorado, whittling the deficit to four, with chances to get closer. But just like many of the 14 Pac-12 losses this season, there was an empty feeling that comes with coming close but not achieving the desired result. “The wins weren’t what we wanted, so from that point of view, obviously a disappointing year. But this team had no quit all year. Not one game did this team quit,” OSU coach Scott Rueck said. “I thought it was just another inspiring performance by our team.” Oregon State heads into the offseason with a roster Rueck believes could be “very special” in a year or two. It includes five freshmen, several who had banner first years. Raegan Beers was the Pac-12′s freshman and sixth person of the year. Timea Gardiner, one of the nation’s top recruits for the class of 2022, showed her potential despite missing three months of the season. Adlee Blacklock could soon become one of the conference’s best perimeter scorers. Lily Hansford and Martha Pietsch had moments. Several veterans, like Talia von Oelhoffen, A.J. Marotte, Shalexxus Aaron and Jelena Mitrovic – if she decides to begin a post-graduate school path – give reason to think Rueck might be right. But. There’s always a but. It’s the next few months, which in recent years have turned college basketball upside down because of the transfer portal. It left a big hole in OSU’s roster a year ago, when four key players left for other schools. What confidence does Rueck have that OSU’s roster largely stays intact for the 2023-24 season? Rueck’s sense is this team is much like his teams before the pandemic, where he says he lost four transfers over a 23-year period. “But, anything’s possible. In this day and age, I show up and I work with what I’ve got and do my best every single day. Whatever happens, happens,” Rueck said. “My hope is obviously everyone stays. I love this team.” One player who won’t advance to next season is Bendu Yeaney. The sixth-year senior transferred to Oregon State for her final year, after making stops at Indiana and Arizona. Yeaney wanted to come home – she grew up in Portland and graduated from St. Mary’s Academy – and make an impact on OSU’s program. Yeaney became an emotional leader, and particularly when von Oelhoffen was sidelined with an injury, the lead guard. For someone who has experienced some incredible highs in college basketball – Yeaney played on Arizona’s NCAA runnerup team two years ago – a 13-18 record is a letdown. It didn’t deter from the experience, though. “We were up and down sometimes, but it was fun. I’m happy. I’m not happy about how it turned out, but I’m happy that I came back home,” Yeaney said. “I think we grew as a team. Hopefully I helped them with their leadership for years to come.” --Nick Daschel | |",

The Shiba Inu Community removed a whopping 43,192,603 (43.19M) SHIB from circulation forever through nine individual transactions in the past 24 hours. This is a remarkable achievement, especially compared to the previous day , when only 539,295 Shiba Inu tokens were destroyed in two transactions, resulting in an unprecedented surge of 7909% in the SHIB burn rate. The wallet tagged “thehammerman.eth” has burned the highest number of Shiba Inu tokens in the past day. As per data provided by Etherscan.io, this wallet sent a massive amount of 23,000,000 (23M) SHIB to the “inferno” address in a single transaction , which was carried out just an hour ago from the time of writing. After this significant burn, the wallet still holds only 40,177,592 (40.17M) SHIB. Besides 24-hour burn, SHIB Army has incinerated 352,210,738 (352.21M) SHIB through 128 separate transactions in February compared to January, where 1.12 Billion Shib were burnt. This shows a significant decline in burns in February, but March has started with a massive spike in SHIB burns. Let’s see if Shib burns can cross a billion in March. On the other hand, the native gas token of Shiba Inu’s L2 Network, Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), is garnering attention from major exchanges. As reported by The Crypto Basic, the major exchange with over 50 million registered users, Crypto.com has recently added support for BONE on its platform. Meanwhile, Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer of SHIB hinted at the possible release of Shibarium Beta in the coming days.

            "content": "SEC Registration Costs a Lot for Crypto Firms FOX Journalist Reveals. Through its Chair, Gary Gensler, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has often called on crypto firms to “come in and register.” However, the path to do this has remained opaque, as agreed by Hester Peirce, an SEC commissioner. Additionally, crypto firms have often lamented the SEC’s unwillingness to respond to inquiries. However, FOX Business Journalist Eleanor Terrett has taken a significant step to demystify this process. No, it is not as simple as filling out forms on the SEC website. In a Twitter thread yesterday, Terrett revealed that she sat down with INX, which claims to be the first SEC-registered crypto trading platform, to see how it achieved this. According to Terrett, the Canadian-based crypto firm disclosed that it filed the SEC’s F-1 form, which the agency requires of foreign entities issuing certain securities. Notably, the process, which started in 2018, took 953 days (about two and a half years) and cost $2 million in legal fees. In addition, the journalist highlighted that other firms are exploring registration through the Regulation A form, which exempts a firm from registering a public offering. According to Terrett, others are going through the Regulation D or Regulation S registration process, which would restrict offerings to accredited investors. Judging by these examples, the cost and the time required to register with the SEC create a significant barrier to entry into the crypto markets, feasible only for startups with deep pockets. Consequently, it could significantly discourage competition and encourage monopolies. As highlighted in a report today, Ripple General Counsel Stuart Alderoty has urged crypto startups to launch and build outside the U.S., citing the lack of regulatory clarity that makes compliance difficult.",

It was the seventh consecutive win for Oregon State (7-1), but it came in a decidedly different fashion than most of the others in its streak. Heading into the matchup, the Beavers had scored at least 11 runs in each of their previous five games, outscoring foes by an average margin of 14.2 to 2.4. The dominant stretch included a commanding over Coppin State last weekend, during which OSU erupted for 46 runs, 45 hits and 37 walks, while scoring runs in 17 of the 24 innings it batted. It was a much quieter offensive outing Thursday. The Beavers finished with 10 hits and four walks, but went just 2 for 15 with runners in scoring position. And when Cal Poly (2-5) scored four runs on two hits in the bottom of the fourth inning, the Beavers were staring at a 4-3 deficit — their first since the fifth inning of the third game of the season. Oregon State squandered a pair of late-inning chances to break the game open, leaving runners on first and second in the fifth before leaving the bases loaded in the seventh. But, finally, the Beavers broke through in the eighth with some small ball and a clutch base hit. , who continued his hot start to the season, was beaned to open the inning, and the Beavers followed with a pair of bunts — Tanner Smith laid down a single to third base and Kyle Dernedde followed with a sacrifice to first — to put runners on first and second with one out. After a Micah McDowell strikeout, Bazzana crushed a two-run double off the fence in right-center, sending Kane and Smith home to give the Beavers a one-run lead. Cal Poly put two runners on base in the bottom of the eighth, but closer ended the threat with a strikeout and flyout, then worked around a leadoff single and walk in the ninth to earn his second save of the season. Five Oregon State relievers combined to allow just three hits and one unearned run over six innings, keeping the Beavers close until Bazzana could deliver his game-winning double. (2-0) earned the win by tossing a scoreless seventh inning, and Rhett Larson finished with a no-decision in his first start at Oregon State, allowing five hits and two earned runs in three innings. And while the lineup didn’t slug its way to another double-digit outburst, it had its moments. Brady Kasper and Kane hit back-to-back solo home runs in fourth inning, Bazzana and Gavin Turley went 2 for 5 and Garret Forrester finished 1 for 3 with a double and two walks. Kane’s homer extended his season-opening hit streak to eight games. Oregon State and Cal Poly play Game 2 of the four-game series at 6 p.m. Friday. — | | 503-294-5183 | | Subscribe to The Oregonian/OregonLive and for the latest news and top stories.",

            "content": "briefly flirted with a dream postseason run before the inside strength of Aaronette Vonleh and a Colorado defensive switch ended the Beavers’ 2022-23 season. Vonleh punished OSU inside, scoring 15 points, and Jaylyn Sherrod jumpstarted the Buffaloes’ defense midway through the second quarter, leading third-seeded Colorado to a 62-54 win Thursday night in a Pac-12 tournament quarterfinal in Las Vegas. Colorado (23-7) earned a berth in Friday’s semifinals, playing Washington State at 8:30 p.m. Friday. The seventh-seeded Cougars advanced by stunning No. 2 seed Utah 66-58 Thursday. The 11th-seeded Beavers, coming off Wednesday’s win over sixth-seeded USC, had a nine-point lead in the second quarter and plenty of momentum when Vonleh and defensive ace Jaylyn Sherrod took over. The third-seeded Buffaloes quickly erased the deficit, stormed to a double-digit lead during the third quarter, then held off a late OSU rally to advance. Though Oregon State’s season ends with a 13-18 record, the Beavers and their freshman-heavy roster showed promise down the stretch. OSU finished the season with wins over NCAA Tournament-bound Arizona and USC, then threw a scare into Colorado. Adlee Blacklock scored 12 points, while A.J. Marotte and Timea Gardiner had 10 each for Oregon State. Aside from Vonleh — a West Linn High School grad — Colorado wing Frida Formann led all scorers with 16 points. Raegan Beers, OSU’s leading scorer this season, had a tough night, going scoreless until the fourth quarter. The freshman forward had seven points. Colorado rallied from a nine-point deficit to tie OSU 33-33 at halftime. The Beavers had things going at both ends for a good deal of the first half. Spotting Colorado an 8-5 lead, OSU went on a 10-3 run, as Marotte hit back-to-back threes. By quarter’s end, the Beavers led 20-15. OSU continued to be the aggressor early in the second quarter. A Bendu Yeaney drive and a three-pointer by Gardiner staked the Beavers to a 27-18 lead. Oregon State led 31-24 with 4:41 left when Colorado started to generate offense. A pair of threes by Formann helped the Buffaloes finish the half on a 9-2 run and tie the game. Oregon State’s offensive opportunities started to shrink when Colorado switched Sherrod on Yeaney, the Beavers’ ballhander. Sherrod, on the all-conference defensive team, pressured Yeaney for the entire court. It took a toll for a while. Meanwhile, Vonleh began to cook. She scored eight of Colorado’s first 11 points of the third as the Buffaloes took their largest lead at 44-37. Colorado led 51-41 heading to the fourth, and appeared to be comfortably on its way to victory. Leading 56-45 with 5:43 remaining, Colorado instead had to fend off an OSU rally. Blacklock, Beers and Gardiner hit three-pointers as the Beavers trimmed the deficit to 58-54 with 1:14 left. But Oregon State’s comeback ran out of gas, as did its season. |",
